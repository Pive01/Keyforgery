# Keyforgery

Flutter app for managing Keyforge decks

This is the Flutter transformation of an old projet made in Java https://github.com/Pive01/Keyforge_managemet
Once on the playStore you'll see this as an update of the old project since I've kept package-name and similar database structure (meaning that you won't loose the data you previously had)

# Current Features
- Search deck through it's name
